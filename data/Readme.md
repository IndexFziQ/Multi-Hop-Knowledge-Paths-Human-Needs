We propose an effective two-step method to extract multi-hop knowledge paths that associate concepts from the text with human need categories: (i) collect all potentially relevant knowledge relations among concepts and human needs
in a subgraph for each input sentence; (ii) rank, filter and select high-quality paths using graph-based
local measures and graph centrality algorithms.
